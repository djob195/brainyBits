# Fixed-Size Heap in Python

A Python implementation of a **fixed-size binary heap** (max-heap or min-heap) with unit tests.  
This repository is based on the data structures and algorithms featured in my blog.

## Features

- Supports **max-heap** and **min-heap**
- Fixed-size heap with capacity check
- `push()` to insert elements respecting priority
- `pop()` to extract the priority element
- Check if the heap is **empty** or **full**
- Fully tested with **unit tests**

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd heap_project
```

No external libraries are required, only Python 3.x.
